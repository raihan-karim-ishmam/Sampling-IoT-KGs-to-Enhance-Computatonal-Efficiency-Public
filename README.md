# Sampling-IoT-KGs-to-Enhance-Computatonal-Efficiency-Public
 
 As a part of the European Interconnect Project, this study investigates the sampling of IoT KGs, reducing them to a manageable size while maintaining good computational properties to answer relevant user queries. Our algorithm uses semantic filters based on relational properties to sample desired parts of the KG. The algorithm is extendable to other SAREF-based KGs.
